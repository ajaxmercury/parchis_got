                Parcheesi is played on a cross-shaped board around which 68 squares are arranged, 16 of which (duly differentiated from the others) constitute the so-called insurance. Four groups of four cards with a different color are used for each of the groups. </br>
                 Each player uses the chip group of one of the colors. 
                </br>

        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
            There are also four spaces outside of what is the career path itself and each of the respective color of each group of chips, or houses, in which each player stores the chips that at that time are not incorporated into the game. </br>
            The chips advance along the course of 68 squares as indicated by the 6-sided die that each player must throw in alternate turns.
