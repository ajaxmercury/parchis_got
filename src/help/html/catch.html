            <span class="Estilo1">
                When, after counting the corresponding number, a token falls, in a box occupied by a token of a different color, the
                first must eat the one there, returning the food to home card (logically waiting for a new 5 to re-enter game).
            </span>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
            When a chip is eaten, the player who eats must advance any one of his chips in a number of 20 boxes. </br>
            An exception to the previous rule is the case that the card that already occupied the box first, was doing it in
            insurance, in which case they can share this box cards of different color in a maximum number of two for insurance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
            If a token should end its movement in an insurance occupied by 2 tokens, the move would not be made. </br>
            The starting boxes of each color operate as ordinary insurance with the particularity that if they are occupied by two
            chips and either one of them, or both, is of a different color from that of the box, if the player who plays with the
            color of the box He had some token at home, and in his turn he had a 5, he would take out a chip, although there would
            be no space in the insurance, eating the last of the arrivals at that box (he would count twenty with any of his chips
            later as in any other capture).
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
            When repeating a run in a series of two consecutive 6, if a third 6 was reappeared in the corresponding third roll, the
            chip with which the last move was made must return home as if it had been eaten by an opponent without, nobody benefits
            from counting 20 for that capture, and the turn ends without moving for the third 6.
