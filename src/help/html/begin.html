            At the begining of the game the chips are placed in the home of its own color.
            <br>
            Players roll the dice in successive turns. It is usually decided which is the player who starts playing by throwing it
            with the die at the highest number. From the beginning, the game will continue to assign successive turns from left to
            right. <br>
            <br>
            The players will be incorporating chips in the playing area only when they roll five, and at the rate of only one chip
            per spin. This incorporation will be mandatory every time a player in his turn has a five and has a chip at home. In
            these cases, and after the subsequent 5, the player will remove one of his house chips by placing it in the exit box /
            insurance of his color. </p>
