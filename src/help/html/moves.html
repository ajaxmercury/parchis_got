                Once you have a chip on the field of play, the player throwing the dice must advance his chip as many squares as the
                dice indicate, in the sense of the ascending numbering of them (counterclockwise).
            </span>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
            If there is more than one chip in play, you can choose to move the one that most interests the player. </br>
            Exceptionally, and only when none of the four tiles of the color of the piece to be moved are in your home, the value 6
            of the dice must be translated on the board in a 7-space advance. </br>
            Whenever a turn is taken 6, after making the corresponding movement, it will be repeated until a maximum of two
            repetitions (that is, three rolls).
