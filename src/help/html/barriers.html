        <h3>Barriers in the Game</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="Estilo1">
                If a player choose in a step to place one chip in a box already occupied by another chip with the same color, this
                will be a barrier.
                <br/>
                Barriers make impossible the step of any chip toward the goal (even chips of the owner of the barrier).
            </span></p>
            <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
                If a chip would not complete the step by the total number of boxes that correspond, then the movement would not be made.
                <br/>
                When a player have a barrier by some of their chips, and in his turn he throw a 6, he would be enforce to open the barrier, it means to move one of the chip that take part of the barrier.
