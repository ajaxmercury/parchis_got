            <span class="Estilo1">
                When a piece has gone around the board and reaches the lower part of the hallway of its color, it will begin to ascend through the boxes in it. </br>
                <br>
                <br>
                To enter the goal box the corresponding player will have to do so by counting the exact number of boxes that correspond to him in his movement, from the one in which he is to the central square of arrival: if the route was shorter than the number indicated by the dice, the movement would not take place. </br>
                When a piece reaches the final square of arrival, the player must advance any of his remaining number ten. </br>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
            Only chips of that color may enter in the arrival hall of one color; therefore, catches are not possible in it. </br>
            If in a series of successive rolls of 6, with the second movement of 6, a chip ends up in a square of the corridor of
            arrival of its color, and in the corresponding third roll another 6 comes out, said chip will not make any movement but
            neither will remain captured, as would happen if these circumstances concurred anywhere else on the board. </br>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">
            The game ends when a player manages to enter each of his chips in his respective final box. At any time you should be
            able to save the game state to a file and load it to continue a previously started game.
